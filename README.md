# ICCT Kotlin Workshop - Food Delivery API

A hands-on workshop where students learn Kotlin by building a food delivery API. No prior Kotlin experience required -- just bring your laptop and curiosity.

**Event:** February 5, 2026, 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM at ICCT College

## Exercises

The workshop is organized into four levels of increasing difficulty:

- **Level 1: Bug Hunt** -- Read existing Kotlin code and fix the bugs. Great for getting familiar with the syntax.
- **Level 2: Guided Implementation** -- Implement features using sealed classes, `when` expressions, and other Kotlin fundamentals with step-by-step guidance.
- **Level 3: Open-Ended** -- Tackle collection processing challenges with `filter`, `map`, `groupBy`, and more. Multiple valid solutions exist.
- **Level 4: Create Your Own** -- Design and implement a new feature from scratch. Show us what you learned.

See [EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md) for detailed instructions on each level.
